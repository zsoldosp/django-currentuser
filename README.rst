Quickstart
----------

Install django-currentuser::

    pip install django-currentuser

Add it to the middleware classes in your settings.py::

    MIDDLEWARE = (
        ...,
        'django_currentuser.middleware.ThreadLocalUserMiddleware',
    )

Then use it in a project::

    from django_currentuser.middleware import (
        get_current_user, get_current_authenticated_user)

    # As model field:
    from django_currentuser.db.models import CurrentUserField
    class Foo(models.Model):
        created_by = CurrentUserField()


Differences to django-cuser
---------------------------

Both libraries serve the same purpose, but be aware of these
differences (as of django-cuser v.2017.3.16):

- django-currentuser's CurrentUserField stores the reference to the request user
  at initialization of the model instance and still allows you to overwrite the
  value before saving. django-cuser sets the value in the pre_save handler
  of the field just before writing it to the database. Intermediate changes
  will be ignored.

- django-cuser deletes the user reference from the thread after finishing a
  response and it will therefore no longer be available for testing purposes.
